Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were not receiving treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension or if they were receiving a stable dose of an endothelin-receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, or both. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or a complication related to pulmonary arterial hypertension up to the end of the treatment period (defined for each patient as 7 days after the date of the last intake of selexipag or placebo).\"\"\"\n",

Disease progression and hospitalization accounted for 81.9% of the events. The effect of selexipag with respect to the primary end point was similar in the subgroup of patients who were not receiving treatment for the disease at baseline and in the subgroup of patients who were already receiving treatment at baseline (including those who were receiving a combination of two therapies).

Current recommendations support the use of a combination of therapies that target the endothelin, nitric-oxide, and prostacyclin pathways.

We conducted an event-driven, phase 3 trial, the Prostacyclin (PGI2) Receptor Agonist In Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (GRIPHON) study, to investigate the safety and efficacy of selexipag in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who were not receiving therapy at baseline and those who were already receiving one or two therapies for the disease at baseline.\"\"\"\n"

The steering committee, in collaboration with the sponsor (Actelion Pharmaceuticals), designed the trial and oversaw its conduct and the analyses of the data. The study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org, was approved by the review board or ethics committee at each participating site. The study was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). The collection, management, and analysis of the data were performed by the sponsor according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan (available with the protocol) that was reviewed by two independent academic statisticians. All drafts of themanuscript were written by the first author and the last two (senior) authors, as well as the three authors affiliated with the sponsor, and were reviewed and edited by all the authors. The steering committee members, all of whom are authors of this article, and the three authors affiliated with Actelion Pharmaceuticals were involved in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All the authors had access to the data and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the analyses and for the fidelity of this report to the study protocol.\"\"\"\n",

Confirmation of the diagnosis by means of right heart catheterization was required before screening. Patients were required to have a pulmonary vascular resistance of at least 5 Wood units (400 dyn sec cm−5) and a 6-minute walk distance of 50 to 450 m. Patients who were not receiving treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension and those who were receiving an endothelin-receptor antagonist, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, or both at a dose that had been stable for at least 3 months were eligible for enrollment; patients who were receiving prostacyclin analogues were not eligible. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients.\"\"\"\n",

During the 12-week dose-adjustment phase, selexipag was initiated at a dose of 200 mg twice daily and was increased weekly in twice-daily increments of 200 mg until unmanageable adverse effects associated with prostacyclin use, such as headache or jaw pain, developed (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The dose was then decreased by 200 mg in both daily doses, and this reduced dose was considered to be the maximum tolerated dose for that patient. The maximum dose allowed was 1600 mg twice daily. After 12 weeks, patients entered the maintenance phase of the study. Starting at week 26, doses could be increased at scheduled visits; dose reductions were allowed at any time. The individualized maintenance dose was defined as the dose that a patient received for the longest duration.\"\"\"\n",

The end of the treatment period was defined for each patient as 7 days after the last intake of selexipag or placebo (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). As outlined in Figure 1, the end of the treatment period occurred at the end of the study (for patients who did not have a primary end-point event), after the occurrence of a primary endpoint event, or prematurely for various reasons, such as an adverse event. The end of the study was declared when the prespecified number of primary end-point events in the study population was reached (see the Statistical Analysis section below).\"\"\"\n",

Adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded throughout the treatment period and up to 7 days (for adverse events) and 30 days (for serious adverse events) after the last intake of selexipag or placebo.

Complications related to pulmonary arterial hypertension were disease progression or worsening of pulmonary arterial hypertension that resulted in hospitalization, initiation of parenteral prostanoid therapy or long-term oxygen therapy, or the need for lung transplantation or balloon atrial septostomy as judged by the physician. (Placement on a transplant waiting list represented an acute measure, as confirmed by the critical-event committee, and an actual lung transplantation would also meet this criterion.) Disease progression was defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 15% in the 6-minute walk distance (confirmed by means of a second test on a different day) accompanied by a worsening in WHO functional class (for the patients with WHO functional class II or III at baseline) or the need for additional treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (for the patients with WHO functional class III or IV at baseline). An independent critical-event committee whose members were unaware of the study-group assignments adjudicated all events up to the end of the study, including each death, to determine whether it was due to pulmonary arterial hypertension.\"\"\"\n",

The change in N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level from baseline to week 26 was analyzed as an exploratory end point. Safety end points included adverse events and abnormal results from laboratory studies.\"\"\"\n",

We calculated that to reach that number of primary end-point events, we would need to enroll 670 patients over the course of 2 years, assuming an annual rate of attrition of 5%. Twenty months after the study was initiated, a blinded review of baseline data from 154 patients indicated that more patients than expected were receiving background therapy for their disease. Therefore, the hypothesized hazard ratio was changed from 0.57 to 0.65 to reflect a lower anticipated treatment effect. To preserve the type 1 and type 2 error rates and the study duration, the required number of primary end-point events was increased to 331 and the required number of patients was increased to 1150. An independent data and safety monitoring committee performed an interim analysis, which had been planned after 202 events had occurred, with stopping rules for futility and efficacy that were based on Haybittle–Peto boundaries. The final analysis used a one-sided significance level of 0.00499.\"\"\"\n"

Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for premature discontinuations of placebo or selexipag, and an analysis of the primary end point was performed that excluded the 45 events that occurred before the sample size was increased (see Section 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). We also performed subgroup analyses that included interaction tests.13 In addition, the primary end point was analyzed according to prespecified dose strata: low doses (200 or 400 mg twice daily), medium doses (600, 800, or 1000 mg twice daily), and high doses (1200, 1400, or 1600 mg twice daily).\"\"\"\n",
